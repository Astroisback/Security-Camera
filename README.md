# Real-Time Camera Streaming and Recording with Flask

This project demonstrates real-time camera streaming and recording using Flask. It utilizes OpenCV to capture video frames from the camera, Flask to serve the video stream over a web interface, and allows for real-time recording when certain conditions are met (e.g., face or body detection).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Flask

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Run the main File.

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` to view the live camera stream.

3. Press 'q' on your keyboard to stop the program and close the streaming window.

## Features

- Real-time camera streaming over a web interface.
- Date, time, and seconds displayed on the video stream.
- Automatic recording when faces or bodies are detected.
- Adjustable frame rate for streaming and recording.
